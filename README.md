# YOLO-Crunch - In development

Achieve 10-15 FPS on Raspberry 3B+ using NNPack, OpenCV 3.4.0 and a micro-sized model

Model designed for three or less object classes and not meant as a replacement or improvement to YOLO, Tiny-YOLO or Tiny Darknet.

Included model predicts a single class, 'person'.

*NOTE: Darknet Demo in NNPack does not work yet, but I will create an updated demo.c here soon to allow fast this live video.  Check back soon.
